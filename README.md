- [Nonlinear Regression Models](#nonlinear-regression-models)
- [Classification Models](#classification-models)
- [Unsupervised Models](#unsupervised-models)

## Linear Regression Models
Linear regression is a technique used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This model is commonly used to understand underlying trends in data and make predictions.

**Algorithms Used:**
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNET Regression

## Nonlinear Regression Models
Nonlinear models is used for cases where the relationship between dependent and independent variables is not linear. These models are suitable for data with more complex relationships.

**Algorithms Used:**
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Multi-layer Perceptron Regression (MLP Regression)
- Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Light GBM (LGBM)
- CatBoost

## Classification Models
Classification models are used to categorize data into specific classes. These models are widely used for identifying and predicting classes within a given dataset.

**Algorithms Used:**
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Multi-layer Perceptron Regression (MLP Regression)
- Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Light GBM (LGBM)
- CatBoost

## Unsupervised Models
Unsupervised models operate on unlabeled data and are used for exploring the structure of data. These models are ideal for clustering or dimensionality reduction tasks.

**Algorithms Used:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
